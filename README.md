## Application Under Test

- **App:** [Contact List App](https://thinking-tester-contact-list.herokuapp.com/)  
- **API Documentation:** [Contact List Documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/4012288/TzK2bEa8)

### Team Assignments

- **Team 1:** Focus on **Contacts APIs**
- **Team 2:** Focus on **Users APIs**

---

## Tools Used

- Trello
- Postman
- Microsoft Excel

---

## Guidelines

- Create a **new Postman workspace** and invite all team members.
- Set up a **new Trello board**:
  - Create a card for each API
  - Assign tasks clearly
- Ensure Postman Collection:
  - Is well-structured and organized
  - Includes requests for all relevant API endpoints
  - Contains **tests in the "Tests" tab** (JavaScript assertions)
- Use **environment variables** throughout the collection (e.g., base URLs, tokens)

---

## Tips

- **Positive Test Case:**  
  Example: Send a POST request with all required fields in the JSON body.

- **Negative Test Case:**  
  Example: Send a POST request with missing required fields and verify the proper error response.

- Explore the UI of the app to identify and cover more relevant test scenarios.
